# Starter template

My startup environment for practice in frontend-development. Built with Gulp 4. Based on the [OptimizedHTML 5](https://github.com/agragregra/OptimizedHTML-5).

This template helps to solve the following tasks:

* synchronised browser testing;
* building a project from sources (JS/Pug/SASS);
* code analysis with linters;
* image minification;
* deployment on a remote server.
